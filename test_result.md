## Previous Test Results (Historical)

### Task 1: "Continue to Payment" Button Fix
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING

**What was tested:**
1. Full flow from homepage → Vehicle Selection (Other) → Manual Entry → File Upload → Analysis → Service Selection → Payment
2. Manual service selection when NO services are auto-detected
3. Continue to Payment button enabled state after service selection

**Results:**
- The "Continue to Payment" button correctly enables when services are selected
- Manual service selection from "Add More Services" grid works properly
- All 18 services available for manual selection
- Price calculation updates correctly
- Payment step loads with order summary and PayPal integration

### Task 2: Admin Panel Vehicle Info Display
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING

**What was fixed:**
- Updated AdminPage.js to properly display vehicle information from flat database fields
- The code now supports both:
  - Flat fields: `vehicle_make`, `vehicle_model`, `vehicle_year`, `vehicle_engine`, `vehicle_ecu`
  - Nested objects: `vehicle.make`, `selected_vehicle.make`

**Results:**
- Orders table now shows vehicle info in the Vehicle column (e.g., "2020 Chevrolet Silverado")
- Order detail panel displays full vehicle breakdown:
  - Main header with year/make/model
  - Detailed grid with Make, Model, Year, Engine, ECU
- Falls back to "No vehicle information provided" when data is missing
